# Shift Scheduler

Shift Scheduler is a web application can generate shift schedules for workplaces where employees work flexible hours.
Employees can specify the periods of the week during which they are available to work, as well as the range of hours that they expect to work per week.
Managers can set the hours of operation of their businesses, as well as the number of employees they need per hour, then request the generation of schedules 
that meet their needs, while also respecting their employees' availabilities.
